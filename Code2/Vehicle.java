2. In Vehicle hierarchy, add methods like start and stop in Vehicle and override them in Child classes.

package MethodOverriding;

public class vehicle {
	
	    public void start(){
	        System.out.println("The vehicle started");
	    }
	    public void stop(){
	        System.out.println("The vehicle stopped");
	    }

	}
